# Testimonial From Past students

"I felt the class was incredibly valuable in helping me learn about some of the major topics in the tech community today. Each session revolves around a tech topic, such as Open Source, and then the professor dives into more detail about the history behind the topic, and how it operates today. This has inspired me to read more on my own to stay up to date" -Harrison deRecat Spring 2019
