*What is Docker?*

"Docker unlocks the potential of your organization by giving developers and IT the freedom to build, manage and secure business-critical applications without the fear of technology or infrastructure lock-in.

By combining its industry-leading container engine technology, an enterprise-grade container platform and world-class services, Docker enables you to bring traditional and cloud native applications built on Windows Server, Linux and mainframe into an automated and secure supply chain, advancing dev to ops collaboration and reducing time to value." - [Docker Website] (https://www.docker.com/why-docker)
